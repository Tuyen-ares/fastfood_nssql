# Cursor Rules for FastFood NoSQL Project

## Code Style
- Write all code in English
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use meaningful comments in English

## Project Structure
- Models: app/models.py
- Routes: app/routes/
- Templates: templates/
- Static files: static/

## Database
- MongoDB with collections: users, restaurants, menus, orders, payments, reviews, vouchers
- Use ObjectId for all IDs
- Always convert string IDs to ObjectId when querying

## Authentication
- Use @login_required decorator for protected routes
- Use @role_required for role-based access control
- Get current user with get_current_user() from app.utils.auth

## Error Handling
- Use flash messages for user feedback
- Validate all user inputs
- Handle database errors gracefully

## Best Practices
- Always validate user permissions before operations
- Use transactions where appropriate
- Keep business logic in models, not routes
- Use helper functions for common operations
